# Using the Family Tree Canvas

The canvas is where you build and explore your family tree. Here's how to make the most of it:

## Navigating the Canvas
- **Zoom**: Use your mouse wheel or pinch on a trackpad.
- **Pan**: Click and drag the background to move around.
- **Select**: Click on nodes or edges to select them.

## Focusing and View Modes
- Double-click a person or union node to focus on them.
- Switch between **details** and **photo** view modes for nodes.

## Context Menus
- Right-click on a node or edge for more options (edit, delete, merge, etc.).

## Tips
- Use the toolbar for quick actions (add person, undo/redo, etc.).
- The minimap helps you navigate large trees.
